# News-Classification-by-there-Category
News classification based on there category is a project in which the news is category by there headlines as input and machine will predict in which category it must be in. In this project with different vectorizer technique  from basic(Count ,Tfi df etc) to advance(Glove,word2vec,etc) technique. Also with that used approx  all the  Machine Learning Algorithms and Neural Network technique

## About the App
The News Classification based on category is a flask web application which predicts category of the news with the help of diffrent vectorizers  and model the proper prediction of catergory is predictited

The code is written in Python 3.8.2. If you don't have Python installed, you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Heroku
